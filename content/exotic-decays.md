The Higgs boson is unstable and decays only 10<sup>-22</sup> s (0.0000000000000000000001 seconds) after it is created. Some decays are to particles we already know about, but it has been suggested that it also could decay to new particles that have not been observed until now. Such particles have never been seen in nature to date.

The diagram above shows a Higgs particle decaying into two exotic particles, which then themselves decay into many more particles – this is how an off-centre vertex could be produced. Finding decays like these would be even more interesting than finding the Higgs boson itself, allowing us to obtain direct evidence for a new theory of nature – opening our eyes to an entirely new realm of physics.

**And this is where _you_ come in.** If these exotic decays are real, then they have already happened at the LHC and are sitting in the data we have right now, just waiting to be found by a keen pair of eyes. By helping with this project, you can take us one step closer to a deeper understanding of reality – to answering some of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the universe.
