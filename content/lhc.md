The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the worldâ€™s largest particle collider and the most sophisticated machine ever built. It is based at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN), 100m beneath the French/Swiss border at Geneva. The LHC accelerates beams of particles up to almost the speed of light, before smashing them together inside four giant particle detectors. In doing so, it can recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.

When two beams of particles collide at extremely high energies, new particles can be created using that energy. These new particles then spread outwards from the centre of the detector, appearing as the grey lines you can see in the picture below. However, many of these new particles are unstable and break apart (decay) very soon after they are produced.

If we see an **off-centre vertex**, it tells us that an invisible particle, originally created at the centre, has decayed into other particles that the detector can see. This could be a sign of an exotic Higgs decay!
