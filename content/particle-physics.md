Perhaps the very thing that defines us as a species is our curiosity. For thousands of years, we have asked deep questions about how our universe works and the nature of reality.
What is the world made of? How did the universe begin? What are the ultimate laws it follows? Particle Physics aims to answer the most profound questions we have ever asked, by studying nature on the very smallest of lengths. Today, with incredibly advanced machines, we can finally fulfil that most ancient dream of unravelling the secrets driving our universe.
