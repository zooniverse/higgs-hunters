In 2012, the world of Particle Physics rejoiced with the discovery of the long sought after Higgs boson particle. **But this is just the beginning.** In our search for answers to the most fundamental questions about the nature of reality, we are looking for your help in finding evidence of new physics beyond our current understanding. Through searching for exotic decays (particles falling apart in unexpected ways) in the Large Hadron Collider’s particle collisions, **you** can be a part of the next great revolution in Physics.
The LHC’s computer programs were not designed to look for these decays, but we are willing to bet that a keen pair of human eyes can. So how about it, are you ready to change our understanding of the world?
