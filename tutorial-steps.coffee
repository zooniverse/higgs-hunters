    This is ATLAS, a detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. One of its main purposes is to study the Higgs boson. Some scientists think the Higgs could break apart into exotic particles entirely new to science.

    These images show how particles appear in the ATLAS detector. The lines show the paths of charged particles travelling away from a collision at the centre.

    Your task is to search for tracks appearing 'out of thin air' away from the centre. We call these off-centre vertices. Mark them by clicking on 'Off-centre vertex' on the right hand side, then click to mark the location of the vertex. Then choose how many new tracks appeared. If you don’t see anything interesting in the image, just click “OK” to move to the next one.

    This is a different view we call ‘slice’ – again we want you to mark off-centre vertices and count their tracks. You’ll see different views at random - later we will put all the information together. Don’t worry about the colours of the tracks – those are just the computer’s guess as to where the tracks come from.

    Below each main image is a ‘field guide’ with plenty of examples to help you. Mark anything you think looks curious or interesting using the “strange” category. After each classification, you’ll be given the chance to discuss anything interesting on Talk.

    Happy hunting! Be sure to check out the science pages to learn more about particle physics, and to find out why the off-centre vertices are so important.
