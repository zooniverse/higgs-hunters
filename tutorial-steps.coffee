    The lines in these images follow the path of subatomic particles out from the center. Sometimes these decay in a shower of new particles at a ‘vertex’, splitting into multiple new tracks.

    Your task is to mark any points where a track splits. Click on 'Off-centre vertex' on the right hand side, then click to mark the location of the split. Then choose how many new tracks the first one split into.

    Colored lines indicate lines which the computer thinks share a common vertex. However, the computer is not always right - so count for yourself. One of the reasons we’re doing this to improve the computer system.
