    This is ATLAS, a detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. One of its main purposes is to study the Higgs boson. Some scientists think the Higgs could break apart into exotic particles entirely new to science.

    The lines in these images show the paths of charged subatomic particles travelling away from a collision at the centre. A tell-tale sign of an exotic particle is a group of tracks appearing 'out of thin air' away from the centre - we call this an 'Off-centre vertex'.

    Your task is to search for these off-centre vertices. Can you see the one in this picture? Click on 'Off-centre vertex' on the right hand side, then click to mark the location of the vertex. Then choose how many new tracks appeared.

    This is a different view we call ‘slice’. By combining this with the other view, we can work out where the off-centre vertex is in space. Don’t worry too much about the colours, they are the computer trying to classify the image. The computer doesn’t always get it right though - one of the reasons we’re doing this is to teach it to find off-centre vertices.

    Below the main image is a ‘field guide’ with plenty of examples to help you. Don't worry if you don't see any vertices, they can be quite rare! Mark anything you think looks curious or interesting using the “strange” category. After each classification, you’ll be given the chance to discuss anything interesting on Talk.

    Happy hunting! With your help, we can search for these exotic particles - Physics will never be the same if we find them. Be sure to check out the <strong>science pages</strong> to learn more about particle physics and how off-centre vertices are made.
