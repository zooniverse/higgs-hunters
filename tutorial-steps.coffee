    This is data from ATLAS, a detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. One of its main purposes is to study the decay of the Higgs Boson.

    The lines in these images show the paths of charged subatomic particles travelling out from the centre. Sometimes an uncharged (invisble to the detector) particle decays into a shower of charged particles, making new lines appear 'out of thin air' - we call this an 'Off-centre vertex'.

    Your task is to mark any points where a group of lines appears suddenly outside the centre. Click on 'Off-centre vertex' on the right hand side, then click to mark the location where they first appear. Then choose how many new tracks appeared.

    Colored lines indicate lines which the computer thinks share a common vertex. However, the computer is not always right - so count for yourself. One of the reasons we’re doing this to improve the computer system.

    Don't worry if you don't see any verticies, they ca be qite rare! Mark anything you think looks curious or interesting using the “strange” category. After each classification, you’ll be given the chance to discuss anything interesting on Talk.

    Happy hunting! With your help we can better understand the Higgs Boson and look for new exotic physics. Be sure to check out the science pages to find out why we're looking for these verticies.
